# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 23, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I have restarted the Odin project on my mac - and preparing for when I get my raspberry pi back.

**Thoughts** I am trying hard to work on my grit this year, and doing things that are mentally challenging. This is an important part of this. Consistency is so much more important than

### Day 2: March 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the odin project, feeling a lot more comfortable again with the command line. Raspberry pi tomorrow! I hope!

**Thoughts** Consistency. Grit. It's all the practice of behaviour more than anything.

### Day 3: March 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Today the stuff came for my raspberry pi so I set everything up, spent a LOT of time in the command line, began to create my lecture notes in .md files which is super useful and hopefully a bit more sustainable for me, and brushed up on CSS before beginning to properly refresh Javascript. I did this through the Odin project and Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I am so pleased with how I've managed to turn my raspberry pi set up into a portable set up by using a powerbank. I often find I need things streamlined and simple and I am guilty, as much as the next person, of getting distracted and lost in a doomscroll. It is so refreshing to have a computer that is preventing that. We shall see how I get on. I may look like the strangest person in the library but I'm literally ecstatic.
